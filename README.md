# Welcome

I am currently working on this project, therefore it is not completed yet. 
The goal of this project is to gather an even better understanding of Neural Networks (NN) by coding a 3 layer NN manually with no help from Pytorch/TensorFlow. 
Since when you use libraries it is hard to understand what is really going on behind the scenes to your datasets, so I will be doing it manually. I'm going to be doing a Binary Classification problem and a Regression problem

## The file 'mainclassification.py'  will be made to make predictions on if a person makes over 50k income a year 
## Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult

### Observations: This dataset is unbalanced. Most people make over 50k a year so my (small) Neural Network can't predict a Fale value since 80% of the dataset is true to begin with

## The file 'mainregression.py'  will be made to make predictions on the miles per gallon on a car. 
## Here is the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg

### Observations:
