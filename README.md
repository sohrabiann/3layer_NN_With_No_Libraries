# Welcome

I am currently working on this project, therefore it is not completed yet. 
The goal of this project is to gather an even better understanding of Neural Networks (NN) by coding a 3 layer NN manually with no help from Pytorch/TensorFlow. 
Since when you use libraries it is hard to understand what is really going on behind the scenes to your datasets, so I will be doing it manually.

Currently in the proccess of doing the math and matrix manipulation on paper.
